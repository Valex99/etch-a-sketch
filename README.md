Etch A Sketch Game
This project is a browser-based version of the classic Etch A Sketch toy, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players can draw on a virtual canvas using keyboard or mouse controls, mimicking the original Etch A Sketch experience. The goal is to recreate the nostalgic drawing experience with added functionality and a modern interface.
